## Resume RAG ChatBot

This was a project for my Natural Language Processing class. It is a chatbot with RAG that has professional and educational data from me, so that it will be able to answer user's queries about me using context from my professional and educational experiences.

I used several different LLMs locally to run the chatbot, as well as a PGVector DB locally to store my data. I used sentence transformers and my own data pipeline to transform the data and store it in the database. A full report about the project can be found in `report.md`
