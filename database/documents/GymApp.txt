As Chief Architect, I led the design and implementation of a comprehensive fitness tracking web application built using C# and the .NET framework. The application employed a multi-tier architecture, with an ASP.NET Core backend handling data persistence and business logic, while the frontend utilized Razor Pages for a responsive user interface. I implemented secure user authentication and session management to ensure personal workout data remained private and accessible only to authorized users.
The core functionality included a robust workout logging system where users could record detailed exercise metrics including sets, repetitions, weights, and duration. A key technical challenge I solved was designing a flexible data model that could accommodate various types of exercises while maintaining data integrity. MongoDB was used for our application, due to its flexibility, scalability, and reliability. The system automatically tracked and updated personal records across different exercise categories, implementing efficient database queries to compare new entries against historical data.
The application featured a RESTful API architecture, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components. To ensure code quality and maintainability, I established coding standards for the team and worked on PR reviews for the code base.
As team leader, I coordinated with five other developers, conducting code reviews, managing the Git repository, and organizing weekly sprint meetings to ensure project milestones were met. The project was completed over a 14-week semester and received recognition for its clean architecture and user-friendly design.
