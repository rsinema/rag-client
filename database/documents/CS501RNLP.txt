I completed an advanced Natural Language Processing course focusing on modern transformer architectures and their applications in contemporary NLP tasks. The curriculum provided deep technical insight into transformer architecture, including detailed exploration of self-attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and the encoder-decoder framework that forms the foundation of modern language models.
The course covered comprehensive analysis of key NLP tasks and their implementations:

Machine Translation: Understanding parallel corpus preparation, BLEU score evaluation, and sequence-to-sequence architectures
Text Classification: Exploring fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained models and handling class imbalance
Question Answering: Implementation of attention mechanisms for extractive QA tasks
Text Generation: Study of beam search, nucleus sampling, and other decoding strategies
Text Summarization: Analysis of abstractive and extractive approaches using transformer models

Significant emphasis was placed on evaluation metrics and performance analysis:

Investigation of perplexity and cross-entropy for language modeling tasks
Understanding ROUGE scores for summarization evaluation
Analysis of precision, recall, and F1 scores in various NLP contexts
Study of human evaluation methodologies and their importance in NLP

The practical component culminated in the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, demonstrating real-world application of course concepts. This project integrated various aspects of the curriculum, including:

Implementation of embedding models for semantic text representation
Development of efficient vector similarity search mechanisms
Integration of transformer-based language models for response generation
Design of prompt engineering strategies for improved response quality
Creation of evaluation frameworks to assess system performance

The course provided both theoretical depth and practical experience in implementing state-of-the-art NLP solutions, with particular focus on the transformer architecture that has revolutionized the field.
