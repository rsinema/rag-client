I architected and developed a sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that serves as an intelligent personal knowledge base, capable of providing contextual responses to queries about my professional background and expertise. The application implements a modern full-stack architecture, leveraging React for the frontend, FastAPI in Python for the backend API layer, and PostgreSQL for persistent storage of embeddings and source documents.
The system's core functionality centers around advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, utilizing Hugging Face's open-source transformer models for both text embedding generation and response synthesis. I implemented vector similarity search to efficiently retrieve relevant context from a carefully curated database of personal documents, including project descriptions, academic coursework, and professional experiences. The embedding pipeline processes and indexes various document types, maintaining semantic relationships while optimizing for query performance.
On the technical side, the backend architecture implements async/await patterns in FastAPI for efficient request handling and includes a custom middleware layer for request validation and error handling. The PostgreSQL database schema was designed to efficiently store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings alongside their source documents, utilizing pgvector for vector similarity operations. The React frontend features a real-time chat interface with streaming responses, implementing custom hooks for state management and WebSocket integration for live updates.
Key technical achievements include:

Implementation of an efficient document chunking and embedding pipeline
Integration of vector similarity search using cosine similarity metrics
Development of a context-aware prompt engineering system
Design of a scalable database schema for managing embeddings and source documents
Creation of a responsive, real-time chat interface with streaming capabilities

The application demonstrates a practical implementation of modern AI techniques in a production environment, showcasing the effective combination of frontend, backend, and machine learning technologies to create a personalized information retrieval system.
